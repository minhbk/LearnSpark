Simple examples to familiarize myself with Spark

Batch job, streaming job is running locally because of hardware limitations.

Learn how to use Spark data type: **RDDs**. However, at this time you can use **SQL, Datasets, DataFrames** data type with more information about the structure of both the data and the computation being performed and of course, newer API than **RDDs**

Spark has introduced **Structured Streaming** instead of **Spark streaming** to processing structured data streams with relation queries. I haven't used it but I think it's newer API and better API.
